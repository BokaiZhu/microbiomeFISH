### ARB installation

[The ARB software](http://http://www.arb-home.de/) is a graphically oriented package comprising various tools for sequence database handling and data analysis.



For new TYPO3 installations, there's a 1-click [Aimeos distribution](https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/aimeos_dist) available too. Choose the Aimeos distribution from the list of available distributions in the Extension Manager and you will get a completely set up shop system including demo data for a quick start.
