## Installation

Several softwares are required for this protocol:
1. [ARB](http://www.arb-home.de/downloads.html) for initial probe design
2. R, [OligoArrayAux](http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/OligoArrayAux) microbiomeFISH r package

### ARB installation

If you want to install Aimeos into your existing TYPO3 installation, the [Aimeos extension from the TER](https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/aimeos) is recommended. You can download and install it directly from the Extension Manager of your TYPO3 instance.

For new TYPO3 installations, there's a 1-click [Aimeos distribution](https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/aimeos_dist) available too. Choose the Aimeos distribution from the list of available distributions in the Extension Manager and you will get a completely set up shop system including demo data for a quick start.

### R package and dependencies

The latest version can be installed via composer too. This is especially useful if you want to create new TYPO3 installations automatically or play with the latest code. You need to install the composer package first if it isn't already available:
